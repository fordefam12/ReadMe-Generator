## Description


 A basic budget tracking app is a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals monitor and manage their finances. Users can input their income and expenses, categorize transactions, and set budget limits for various spending categories. The app then tracks and displays real-time spending against the allocated budget, providing a clear snapshot of financial health. It may also generate simple reports and offer insights into spending patterns, enabling users to make informed decisions and improve their money management skills.
